Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. Must-do is a good fucking master. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. This design is fucking brilliant. 

Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. Use your fucking hands. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure. 

Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. Fuck. 

Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment. Don’t fucking lie to yourself. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly.
